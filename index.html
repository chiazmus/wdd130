            <p>Once upon a time there was a bard named Sir Bardulus.  Sir Bardulus was the best bard in the world,<br>
                or so he thought.  However, one day the beloved lute of Sir Bardulus was surreptitiously stolen.  Sir Bardulus was duely distraught,<br>
                and knew not what to do.  He searched and searched but to no avail.  His beloved lute was lost.  Finally, Sir Bardulus sought the <br>
                strange fellow named the Searcher of Sarcath.  The strange Searcher of Sarcath searched with striking sedulousness, finally finding <br>
                in the forlorn forest of fargool the lost lute.  It had been tragically taken by the bold bandits who had placed their bastion therin. <br>
                Rejoicing at the reunion of his recently retrieved beloved lute, Sir Bardulus the Bard vowed never again to lose his lute! <br>
                What does this have to do with me?  Absolutely nothing.  I hope you enjoyed the story though.
